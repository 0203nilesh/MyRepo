a. initialize
b. Working Area 
c. Staging area


1. First we have to initialize the git 
        -> git init
        -> Kepp track of all changes in the file.
2. We can check status 
        -> git status  ( Symbol is U )
3. Add the file to stagin areas
        -> git add index.html ( Symbol is A)
4. Commit to the repository (no Symbol here)
        -> git commit -m "message to commit" 
5. Combine commit and add
        -> git add commit.
6. Create a new branch
        -> git branch test (create a branch)
        -> git checkout test (switch branch);
        -> Change we are making on another branch will not hamper the code of the other branch.
        -> Either new file new code anything we have done in other branch will not affect other.
7. Merge branches 
        -> Testing the changes and satisfied with the output then we can merger them.
        -> The test branch should be clear and not have anything to commit.
        -> git merge test ( callt this from the master)
